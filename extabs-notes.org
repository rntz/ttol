* Background

# Expected
- Inference rules
- BNF

# Need to explain
- Modal logic.
- Adjoint logic.
- Hereditary substitution.


* Story

- Motivation: Talk about ConcertOS, TAL, bridging the typing gap.

- Note first that we're not handling circular library dependencies.

- Libraries are like code with named holes in it (dependencies). Hrm, that looks
  a lot a function! (Note re this view requires noncircularity.)

- Intro modal logic. Initial thought was extension to modal logic. Note re modal
  logic and mobility, confirm suspicions.

- Adjoint logic: lets us put things in the upper layer.

  Lets us express "superstructure" of necessary/mobile things beyond ordinary
  terms.

- Polymorphism. Are type variables necessary or contingent?

- Note regarding suspensions versus values, why we chose values, how this breaks
  exact correspondence with modal logic.

- Initial lambda-calculus.

- Story re partial evaluation.
- Story re canonical/atomic forms.
